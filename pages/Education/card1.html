            Soumitra Dutta:  AI can help in many different ways in helping students enhance the learning
            experience. The most important one is, of course, in personalizing the quality of what they learn and how
            they learn.
            <br><br>
            It’s also important to keep in mind that students have different career objectives. They have
            different skill requirements for the careers they choose, and AI can help customize the kind of skills and
            kind of study areas they focus on for their chosen career areas.
            <br><br>
           AI can also help in connecting students to each other. Let’s say a student has a need in some
            certain section of an assignment. Other sections that student has probably done well and other students have
            performed well in those sections can be connected to the student much more easily using AI.
            <br><br><br>
            <b>AI can help faculty in understanding the learning needs of each student, and customizing the curriculum
                to the needs of every single student.
            </b>
            <br><br>
             Faculty need to then think about how to combine the content into a proper, effective course
            curriculum. Once again, AI can actually help in creating the best course curriculum by helping combine the
            different modules in an effective manner.

             Faculty need to think about how to translate that course curriculum to the students’ needs. How do
            you actually make students learn through the curriculum? As you do so, you need to be able to make sure the
            curriculum at least addresses the individual learning needs of every student to the degree possible.

             AI can once again help the faculty member in understanding the needs, the learning needs of each
            student, and customizing the curriculum to the needs of every single student.

             And, of course, you can look at a post-course situation where the alumni of the course want to be
            sort of updated on the recent developments in that area, connect with other colleagues in the area with what
            work they’re doing.

            So, once again, AI can help keep the community alive and network with each other. So everywhere,
            actually, AI is there in what the faculty does.
